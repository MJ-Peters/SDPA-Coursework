Imagine that you are a fintech entrepreneur with software developer skills. Somehow, your
friend has managed to get you a showcase interview with one of the most important groups of
investors across the globe. Then, you decide to present what you have in mind:

“My software can be seen as an electronic manager of money where customers can have their
funds. The system can perform typical money operations such as withdrawing and depositing
money or transferring money to other customers. The main feature of the system is that customers
can have wallets, which are “money containers” associated with a specific purpose. Namely, daily
use, saving, holidays and mortgage.”

Thus, you need to develop a proof of concept for your idea to show it to the investors.

The choice of the 'encryption strategy’ is yours, but the

You need to comment on the robustness and complexity of your method in the “readme. md”
